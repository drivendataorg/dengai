# DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread

## Goal of the Competition
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. In mild cases, symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, low blood pressure, and even death.

Using environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Government agencies—from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) to the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](http://www.noaa.gov/) in the [U.S. Department of Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/)—can you predict the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru?
