# Predict the Next Pandemic Initiative

***

The data for this competition comes from multiple sources aimed at supporting the [Predict the Next Pandemic Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/06/05/back-future-using-historical-dengue-data-predict-next-epidemic). Dengue surveillance data is provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and prevention, as well as the Department of Defense's Naval Medical Research Unit 6 and the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, in collaboration with the Peruvian government and U.S. universities. Environmental and climate data is provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
